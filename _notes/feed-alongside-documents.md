> Documents' can be living beings. Growing alongside our understanding of things.

I'm turning my blog into a similar concept:

1. Each entry into a document is timestamped. 
2. Blocks of entries will be posted to the feed. 
3. The posts determined by a segment of timestamps that are adjustable.

You can read the documents on their own, dedicated page. Or browse the real-time feed as I am writing.

I may write between many documents and my feed will flow with multiple concepts. Or I might be diving deep into a topic and you can follow along in the feed or in the main document.
